# Mail Classification using Logistic Regression

This project focuses on building a **Mail Classification System** using the **Logistic Regression** algorithm. The primary objective is to automatically classify emails as spam or not spam (ham), which is a common and crucial application in real-world email filtering systems.

### ðŸ“Œ Why is this important?

With the growing volume of email communication, filtering out spam messages is essential for maintaining productivity and security. This project showcases a practical implementation of a supervised machine learning technique for binary classification, helping users understand the complete workflow of developing a basic spam filter.

## ðŸš€ Project Workflow

The project follows a structured machine learning pipeline:

1. **Importing Libraries and Dataset**  
   Load essential Python libraries and the dataset required for classification.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   Clean and prepare the email data by handling null values, converting text to lowercase, removing punctuation, and tokenizing.

3. **Splitting into Training and Test Data**  
   Split the cleaned dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

4. **Feature Extraction**  
   Use text vectorization techniques (like TF-IDF or CountVectorizer) to convert text into numerical features.

5. **Model Training and Evaluation**  
   Train a Logistic Regression model and evaluate it using accuracy, confusion matrix, and other metrics.
